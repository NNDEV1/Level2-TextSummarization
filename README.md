Intermediate submission for Open Source Challenge

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Text summarization in NLP is the process of summarizing the information in large texts for quicker consumption. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). My project takes a link from a website(adjustable by user) and scrapes the raw text from the website. Then from this text my model generates a number of bullet points(adjustable by user) and a summary based on the raw text.  

Here are some resources to learn about text summarization:

* [A Quick Introduction to Text Summarization in Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-introduction-to-text-summarization-in-machine-learning-3d27ccf18a9f)
* [Comprehensive Guide to Text Summarization using Deep Learning in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/comprehensive-guide-text-summarization-using-deep-learning-python/)
* [Text Summarization Approaches for NLP](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/text-summarization-approaches-nlp-example/)
